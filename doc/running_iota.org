* introduction

Iota² is a processing chain developed by the [[http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr][CESBIO]] : [Centre d'Etude Spatiales de la BIOshphère] which produces a land cover images.

Every datas you need are resumed into the "What you need" section.
Before launching the chain it is necessary to declare, thanks to a configuration file, where and how are stored datas. 
It is this configuration file which rules all the test. All parameters of this file are detailed inside the "How to configure Iota" section. 
When inputs are ready, you can launch the chain as described in the next section : "How to launch Iota²". Once the chain is terminated, it produce
a series of folders, and results as describe into the "Products" section.

* What you need

You need to get OTB 5.0 or greater and some other python's packages:

- argparse
- gdal,ogr
- config
- os
- glob
- shutil
- osgeo
- datetime
- collections
- numpy
- time
- scipy
- osr
- random
- matplotlib
- cPickle
- subprocess
- math
- re
- unittest
- filecmp
- gdal

as already mentioned, you also need to fill out a configuration file.

* How to configure Iota²

Currently a configuration file is divided in four parts: Chain, learning, classification, and features. All parts contain fields described below.
Some parameters are directly linked to OTB functions, so for these parameters please refer to [[https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/documentation/][OTB cookbook]]. You must use the simple quote to fill out most 
of the field.

** Chain

This part corresponds to the general description of the test.

The purpose of this parameter is to set a strategy to select samples inside learning polygons (which are compute by iota2). The strategy is apply on each different regions.
It's also possible to set a specific strategy for a given learning region throught the "per_model" key parameter.

In the example above, if the regions shape contains 5 differents regions : "1", "2", "3", "4" the regions "4"
every keys except "per_models" and "target_model" are OTB's sampleSelection parameters. You can add/remove sampleSelection parameter key depending of your sampling methode choice.

(2) CSV format:
column 1 = the model source name
column 2 = the model destination name
column 3 = target class label
column 4 = number of samples to extract (-1 mean extract all)

example :
cat MyRepartition.csv
    1,2,11,5
    2,1,46,-1

5 samples of class 11 will be extracted from model 1 and injected in the model 2
all samples of class 46 will be extracted from model 2 and injected in the model 1

This set of parameters are use to perform data augmentation, more documentation about data augmentation in otb's cookbook at sampleAugmentation application.
In order to use it, please set "activate" to True.
Paramters strategy, strategy.jitter.stdfactor and strategy.smote.neighboatLeastrs are provide by otb's application call sampleAugmentation.
target_models refer to models to compute samples augmentation.

samples.strategy can be atLeast, balance or byClass.
minNumber : An option to generate samples so that all the classes have at least N samples.
balance : An option to balance all classes with the same samples as the majority one
byClass : An option to augment only some of the classes

samples.strategy.minNumber : number of the minimum required samples by class.
samples.strategy.byClass : path to a csv file. First column is the class name, the second one is the minimum of samples for the target class.

(1) Explanation about classifMode's options

- separate :
    every pixels are labelled only by one model, the one which learn the region where the pixel is. 

- fusion : 
    every models labelled every pixel. When a decision can not be taken by the fusion function, the label is chosen by the method indicate into the field noLabelManagement.

(2) Explanation about no labels management

- learningPriority :
    the label is chosen by the classification produced by the model which learn the region where the pixel is. 

- maxConfidence :
    the label is chosen by the classification which produce the maximum confidence score. 

** Features

Today, features computable are : NDVI, NDWI and the brightness. Only two sensors are supported, Landsat_8 and Landsat_5, but some others are coming soon. So you only have to fill out the Landsat_8 block composed by many fields.

(1) Explanation about how to store images

    images must be stored by tiles.
    for example : /path/Landsat8_T/X/Y.tif
    - T : a tile name according to Theia definition : D0001H0005 or D0002H0004 ...
    - X : a folder
    - Y : the image
    
    In that example, L8Path : '/path/' and arbo : '/*/*'
    arbo is the path from L8Path, to find the image.tif    

(2) Features available

    NDVI,NDWI,Brightness

(3) Explanation about batchProcessing mode
    
    in order to produce features, you can choose batchProcessing or not.
    batchProcessing improve computation time, no temporal data are written on disk. However, features can't be choosen. They are NDVI, NDWI and brightness.

(4) Available Bands per Sensors :

Landsat5:
"B1", "B2", "B3", "B4", "B5", "B6", "B7"

Landsat8
"B1", "B2", "B3", "B4", "B5", "B6", "B7"

Sentinel_2
"B2", "B3", "B4", "B5", "B6", "B7", "B8", "B8A", "B11", "B12"

Sentinel_2_S2C
"B2", "B3", "B4", "B5", "B6", "B7", "B8", "B8A", "B11", "B12"

Once the configuration file fill out, the chain can be launch.

* How to launch Iota²

you only have to launch the python script as describe below:

#+RESNAME:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
python /script/Iota2.py -config /path/to/theConfigurationFile.cfg
#+END_EXAMPLE

or thanks to MPI : 

#+RESNAME:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
mpirun -np XX python /script/Iota2.py -config /path/to/theConfigurationFile.cfg
#+END_EXAMPLE

where XX is the number of MPI processes.

in order to accelerate computations, you can set the environnement variable 'ITK_GLOBAL_DEFAULT_NUMBER_OF_THREADS'

#+RESNAME:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
mpirun -x ITK_GLOBAL_DEFAULT_NUMBER_OF_THREADS=10 -np 4 python /script/iota2.py -config /path/to/theConfigurationFile.cfg
#+END_EXAMPLE

This last exemple mean that iota² will launch 4 MPI process (3 workers and 1 master) and each process will use 10 threads
* Products

Each chain creates a tree folder, from the path given in field output, as describe below
